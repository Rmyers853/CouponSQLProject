## Overview

This project was built to provide a simple class to represent an expression tree (term-operator-term) with support for nested expressions, literals, arrays, and lists.

## Deserialization from JSON

- Strong naming

## Simple Example
```csharp
using ExpressionTree;

Expr e = new Expr(5, OperatorEnum.GreaterThan, 1);
```

## Nested Example
```csharp
Expr e = new Expr(
	new Expr(5, OperatorEnum.GreaterThan, 1),
	OperatorEnum.And,
	new Expr("Name", OperatorEnum.In, new List<string> { "Smith", "Anderson", "Jones" })
	);
```
